TODO:

1. I understand some of the surface normals and textures are not yet implemented. This will be fixed on the submission of the final version.

2. The lighting that I have is temporary, it will eventually be replaced with torches. I'm looking into doing fire for it but the first step is just to simulate light coming from the torches. I got a little tripped up so I'm going to office hours to get it figured out.

3. There will be more artifacts added to the scene.

4. I'm looking to add better textures, namely the one I currently have for the wall and ceiling dont natural so I'll be looking for something else.

5. I'm going to add more interesting stuff to the table, like goblets and dice and a board.

6. General Code Cleanup, I know a lot of it is kinda ugly but I'll take time once everything is wrapped up to abstract the right things and remove unecessary comments :)



TIME SPENT:
I've spent about 25 hours coding for this project.
