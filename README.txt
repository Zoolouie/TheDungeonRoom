Things I'm Proud Of:
I think that the cube artifact, the circle artifact surrounded by multiple torus and the gate all turned out really well! I'm also proud of making decent looking fire - event if it's just represented by a bunch of triangles. Finally, I'm really happy with how the scene turned out, I think I capture the vibe of a dungeons and dragons room really well in the end!
